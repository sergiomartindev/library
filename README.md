## Library

Welcome to my project! In this small CRUD application, I have aimed to apply the GRASP Patterns and SOLID Principles in order to improve its design and maintainability. Although the functionality is currently limited, I have focused on creating a solid foundation for future development.

Through this project, I have sought to showcase my understanding of object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. The application is built using JavaScript and TypeScript, and it features a clear separation of concerns between its different parts.

Feel free to explore the code and give me your feedback.
